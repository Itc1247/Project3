The Castle town is explorable. The houses are empty,only the blacksmith and tavern have props inside. The lights in the
blacksmiths work. There is a delay when you hit the ceiling after you jump on the ground floor of the blacksmiths. Its like 
you get stuck for a moment and then after the delay you fall back down.
